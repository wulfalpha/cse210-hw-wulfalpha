1. What does the program do?
Program assists in memorizing verses. It does this by randomly removing words one at a time until the entire verse is blanked.
2. What user inputs does it have?
Press Enter or type quit. (empty string or specific string.)
3. What output does it produce?
As above it produces verses and blanks them out word by word until the user has had a chance to memorize the entire passage.
4. How does the program end?
Program ends in two ways. Eithr the last word is blanked out or the user types quit at any time.

Each Class performs part of the whole:
Class Scripture displayes the scripture verse by verse and hides the words as the user moves through the program.

Class reference randomly selects from a map of references and serves them up.

class Word hides words randomly and knows how many words are hidden.
(Posible improvement: put hidden words in a map so user can type them in? if they get the word right it should appear and then disseappear again for a reminder.)
